# icml16_iapi
Implementation of the IAPI algorithm and a power-system real-time simulator, as described in "Hierarchical Decision Making In Electricity Grid Management" (Dalal et al., ICML 2016).

27/6/16 update: 
- As of now, the code is pretty messy and fitted to our cluster system. During this week I'll fix it to be much more user friendly, with more documentation and independent on the system. I'll also add a figure describing external package dependencies.
- In addition, we'll try to use a cool new tool, http://codeocean.com, that is suppose to abstract away all these dependencies by running all the simulator part on the cloud.
